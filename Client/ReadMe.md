## Introduction
A non existing user will be not be able to view any pages on the website. A user must pass the authentication before being a registered user. Exisitng users will be able to log in and view the all other drivers or passengers stored in the database. A user eill be able to search for a particular user, filter users by gender and day. Once the desired user is found, their profile can be viewed by clicking on their name, a conversation can be started by clicking the message icon and the distance between the logged in user and the user listed is displayed. A map has been integrated also, once the map icon is clicked there are two pins on the map to represent the location of th elogged in user and the user that has been clicked on. You can schedule a lift with a user once you message them and you are the driver. Reviews can also be left by clicking on each users profile, review is in the form of a star system and a comment box.

## Improvements
There was some features which I would have wished to implement if I had more time:
1. Allow a user to only try enter an authentication code for an email 3 times
2. Making the site look more attractive to a user
3.  Error messages for the forms could be improved
4. Use more images and more bootstrap
